# Next Implementation Cycle

## Identify Next Implementation Target
- Clearly identify what should be implemented next
- Define specific, testable functionality
- Break down into smallest possible increment

## Plan Minimal Testable Implementation
- Design the minimal code needed to pass a single test
- Focus on one piece of functionality at a time
- Ensure implementation is testable and isolated

## Create TODO List Following TDD Cycle
- Use TodoWrite tool to track implementation steps
- Follow Red-Green-Refactor micro-cycle from @.claude/tdd-workflow.md
- Start implementation with failing test first

## Begin Implementation
- Write ONE failing test for the smallest piece of functionality
- Implement minimal code to make test pass
- Refactor if needed while keeping tests green
- Repeat cycle for next small increment
